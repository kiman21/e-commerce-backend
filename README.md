# e-commerce-backend

## Description
In this project I built the backend routing portion for an online retailer using object-relational mapping to connect an Express API with a MYSQL database.

## Installation
Run `npm i` to install all dependencies. Also a .env file is required for DB_NAME='ecommerce_db', your DB_USER info and DB_PASSWORD info for mysql.

## Usage
This portion is only the backend, so use insomnia to check routes.
